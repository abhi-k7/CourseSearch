Description: This course is intended for students who are taking 15-251 and would like more intensive exposure to theoretical computer science. The goal is to bring interested students closer to the research frontier. The class meets once a week for a lecture and the students are expected to solve a number of homework problems during the course of the semester. The work done in 15-252 does not replace any of the requirements of 15-251. Having achieved a grade of A in 15-151/21-127 is recommended.
