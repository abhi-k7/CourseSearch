Title: 15-351Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures
Course Number: 15-351
Units: 12 units
Prerequisites: 15-121 or 15-122
Corequisites: None
Description: The objective of this course is to study algorithms for general computational problems, with a focus on the principles used to design those algorithms. Efficient data structures will be discussed to support these algorithmic concepts. Topics include: Run time analysis, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, network flow algorithms, linear and integer programming, large-scale search algorithms and heuristics, efficient data storage and query, and NP-completeness. Although this course may have a few programming assignments, it is primarily not a programming course. Instead, it will focus on the design and analysis of algorithms for general classes of problems. This course is not open to CS graduate students who should consider taking 15-651 instead. THIS COURSE IS NOT OPEN TO COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS OR MINORS.
