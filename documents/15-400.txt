Title: 15-400Research Practicum in Computer Science
Course Number: 15-400
Units: 12 units
Prerequisites: 15-300
Corequisites: None
Description: This Spring course is the second part of a two-course sequence that is designed to help prepare students to invent the future state-of-the-art in the field of computer science.  Building directly upon 15-300 (the prerequisite for this course), students will conduct a semester-long independent research project, under the guidance of both the course staff and a faculty project mentor.  The course does not meet for lecture or recitations.  Instead, the students will spend their time working on their research projects, and will also meet with course staff on a bi-weekly basis to discuss their progress.  Students will prepare a written report and a poster presentation at the end of the semester to describe what they have accomplished.
