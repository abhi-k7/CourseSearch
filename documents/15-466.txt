Prerequisites: 15-362 or 15-462
Corequisites: None
Description: The goal of this course is to acquaint students with the code required to turn ideas into games. This includes both runtime systems -- e.g., AI, sound, physics, rendering, and networking -- and the asset pipelines and creative tools that make it possible to author content that uses these systems. In the first part of the course, students will implement small games that focus on specific runtime systems, along with appropriate asset editors or exporters. In the second part, students will work in groups to build a larger, polished, open-ended game project. Students who have completed the course will have the skills required to extend -- or build from scratch -- a modern computer game.  Students wishing to take this class should be familiar with the C++ language and have a basic understanding of the OpenGL API. If you meet these requirements but have not taken Computer Graphics (the formal prerequisite), please contact the instructor.
