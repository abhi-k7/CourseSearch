Title: 15-213Introduction to Computer Systems
Course Number: 15-213
Units: 12 units
Prerequisites: 15-122
Corequisites: None
Description: This course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation. NOTE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS: This course is not open to graduate students beginning Spring 2015. Graduate students must register for 15-513 instead.
