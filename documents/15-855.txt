Title: 15-855Graduate Computational Complexity Theory:
Course Number: 15-855
Units: 12 units
Prerequisites: None
Corequisites: None
Description: Please refer to http://www.cs.cmu.edu/csd-grad/courseschedules21.html for the most recent schedule updates.  This is an advanced course on comptuational complexity theory, covering the foundations of structural complexity up to innovations from the 90s and early 00s.  It is suitable for students who have solid understanding of undergraduate complexity (such as CMUs 15-455, or a course that covers Part III of Sipsers textbook).  Almost all material covered in 15-855 is in the textbook by Arora and Barak, and we will go at a pace that covers about one chapter of Arora--Barak every three lectures.  Topics covered will include nondeterminism, the polynomial-time hierarchy, interactive proofs, approximate counting and P, circuit complexity, and the hardness vs. randomness paradigm.
