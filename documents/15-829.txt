Description: Section O: Description: This class is aimed at computer systems PhD students who are already involved in doing systems research, where the goal is to improve the performance of the system. Improving performance could involve reducing response times, providing class-based response time differentiation, reducing response time latency or improving tail behavior, reducing loss/drop rate, increasing throughput, increasing revenue, creducing power or capacity, etc.  Improving systems performance involves queue management and resource allocation, both major topics in queueing theory. While queueing theory classes traditionally involve heavy mathematics, the goal of this class is to teach systems students the performance modeling/queueing theory in a super intuitive manner, without covering proofs, and without requiring a probability background. The focus of the class will be on learning how to translate computer systems performance problems into the appropriate queueing network framework. Each class is divided into two parts. The first half presents a lesson in queueing theory, modeling, simulation, or workload characterization. The second half is devoted to a current computer systems research problem, presented by a student in the class, where we will figure out together, in real time, how to model this research problem as a queueing network and solve the problem. In between the two halves, we will share pizza Please refer to https://www.cs.cmu.edu/csd-grad/courseschedulef22.html for the most recent schedule updates. COURSES BEGIN THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 6th.
