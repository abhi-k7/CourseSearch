Description: Section H:  Description:  The course covers the implementation of compilers for higher-order typed languages such as ML. Topics include type checking, type directed compilation, elaboration, phase splitting, CPS conversion, closure conversion, allocation, and garbage collection. The course is disjoint from the standard compilers course (15-411); thus, topics such as parsing and code generation are not covered. Students will implement an ML compiler and runtime system as a term project.  Please refer to http://www.cs.cmu.edu/csd-grad/courseschedules20.html this link for the most recent schedule updates.
